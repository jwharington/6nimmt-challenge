Measures to track
- how many slots free in each row
- how many players in game
- cards that have been played
- how many cards remaining

Playing strategies
- choose a safe card to play (no chance of losing round)
- choose a card that has some risk depending on other players
- anticipating a row will be emptied by someone else
- get rid of high cards early
- get rid of low cards early
- play a low card forcing taking a row, to minimise cost

Miscellaneous
- ranking strategies (relative value of options)
